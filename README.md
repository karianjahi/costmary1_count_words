We want to write a package that we can use to count words in a string.

## Steps:
1. Create a repository called "your directory name" on github.com and make a .gitignore file for python
2. Clone the repository to your local machine at a folder of your choice using 'git clone'
3. Change directory to this repo.
4. Create a virtual environment
5. Create a file 'count_words.py' > `touch count_words.py`
6. Create another file 'test_count_words.py' > `touch test_count_words.py`
